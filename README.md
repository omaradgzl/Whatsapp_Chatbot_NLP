# Whatsapp_Chatbot_NLP
This project demonstrates how to build an automated WhatsApp chatbot using Selenium. It interacts with WhatsApp Web, simulating user actions to send and receive messages, and can be used for automating conversations. The chatbot also incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond intelligently to user messages.
